Given the limited context of the `Threading` and `alarm` function definitions (note: `alarm` function isn't defined), I'll write test scenarios based on usual expectations around threading and behavior related to an alarm-like functionality.

### Test Scenarios for `Threading` Function

**Scenario 1: Confirm thread starts successfully**
Details:
  TestName: test_thread_starts_successfully
  Description: Verifies that the `Threading` function successfully starts a new thread when called.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `Thread` class and `alarm` function.
  Act: Call the `Threading` function.
  Assert: Check if `Thread` was initialized with target `alarm` and started.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the threading logic inside the `Threading` method works as intended by starting a new thread targeted at the `alarm` function, simulating the real-world operation of separating the alarm execution from the main program execution.

**Scenario 2: Check for potential exceptions during thread start**
Details:
  TestName: test_thread_start_exception_handling
  Description: Ensures that exceptions, if any are raised during the thread start-up (e.g., initialization errors), are handled or logged appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a scenario where starting a thread would raise an exception (e.g., mocking the Thread start method to raise an Exception).
  Act: Call the `Threading` function under this setup.
  Assert: Confirm that exception is caught or logged accordingly, not causing a system failure.
Validation:
  Threading operations can sometimes lead to runtime issues, and this test ensures robustness by checking for proper exception handling, maintaining program stability even when faults occur at the thread startup.

**Scenario 3: Ensure no interference with main program execution**
Details:
  TestName: test_main_program_continues_execution
  Description: Verifies that the main program execution is unaffected (non-blocking behavior) when the `Threading` function starts a thread.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `alarm` function to have a noticeable delay (simulate long-running task).
  Act: Call the `Threading` function and immediately check for continued program execution.
  Assert: Verify that the subsequent parts of the main program continue to run without waiting for the alarm thread.
Validation:
  As `Threading` should enable concurrent execution, this test confirms that its implementation allows the main application to operate without delay, indicative of proper threading and non-blocking behavior.
