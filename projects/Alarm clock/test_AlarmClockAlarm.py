ROOST_METHOD_HASH=alarm_53fded4622
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=alarm_6edf31f1cc


Scenario 1: Verify Alarm Trigger at Set Time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_triggers_at_set_time
  Description: Ensure that the alarm triggers correctly when the current time matches the set alarm time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock objects for `hour`, `minute`, and `second` to return a specific time. Mock `datetime.datetime.now()` to return a time that matches the alarm time after a few iterations of the loop. Mock `winsound.PlaySound` to verify it is called.
  Act: Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: Check that `winsound.PlaySound` is called exactly once when the current time matches the set alarm time.
Validation:
  Rationalize that this test confirms the primary functionality of the alarm system, ensuring that it triggers the alarm sound at the correct time, which is crucial for user satisfaction and reliability.

Scenario 2: Verify Alarm Does Not Trigger Before Set Time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_does_not_trigger_before_set_time
  Description: Ensure that the alarm does not trigger before the set alarm time is reached.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock objects for `hour`, `minute`, and `second` to return a specific time. Mock `datetime.datetime.now()` to return a time that is before the alarm time initially. Mock `winsound.PlaySound` to verify it is not called prematurely.
  Act: Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: Ensure `winsound.PlaySound` is not called when the current time is before the set alarm time.
Validation:
  Rationalize that this test ensures the alarm system's accuracy by confirming it only triggers at the intended time, preventing false alarms and maintaining user trust.

Scenario 3: Verify Alarm Handles Time Format Correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_handles_time_format_correctly
  Description: Validate that the alarm function correctly interprets and compares the time in "HH:MM:SS" format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `hour`, `minute`, and `second` objects to return values that form a valid time string. Mock `datetime.datetime.now()` to return a time string in the same format. Ensure the time formats match exactly.
  Act: Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function correctly matches the current time and the set alarm time in the "HH:MM:SS" format.
Validation:
  Rationalize that this test ensures the function correctly processes and compares time strings, which is fundamental to the alarm's operation and accuracy.

Scenario 4: Verify Alarm Loop Continuity
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_loop_continuity
  Description: Ensure that the alarm function continues looping and checking the time until the alarm is triggered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `hour`, `minute`, and `second` objects and `datetime.datetime.now()` to simulate multiple iterations where the current time does not initially match the alarm time.
  Act: Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: Verify that the loop continues and `time.sleep(1)` is called repeatedly until the alarm time is reached.
Validation:
  Rationalize that this test confirms the function's ability to continuously monitor the time without prematurely ending, ensuring persistent functionality until the alarm condition is met.

Scenario 5: Verify Multiple Alarms in Sequence
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_alarms_in_sequence
  Description: Test that the alarm function can handle multiple sequential alarms set at different times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `hour`, `minute`, and `second` objects to simulate different alarm times. Mock `datetime.datetime.now()` to progress through different times, triggering multiple alarms. Mock `winsound.PlaySound` to verify it is called for each alarm.
  Act: Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: Ensure `winsound.PlaySound` is called for each set alarm time in sequence.
Validation:
  Rationalize that this test validates the function's ability to handle multiple alarms, ensuring robustness and flexibility for users who need several alarms.
