Scenario 1: Verify Alarm Trigger at Set Time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_triggers_at_set_time
  Description: Ensure that the alarm triggers correctly when the current time matches the set alarm time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock objects for hour, minute, and second to provide a specific time, and mock datetime to return a matching current time.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function.
  Assert: Verify that the "Time to Wake up" message is printed and the sound is played.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the alarm function fulfills its primary purpose of notifying the user when the set time is reached.

Scenario 2: Verify No Alarm Trigger Before Set Time
Details:
  TestName: test_no_alarm_before_set_time
  Description: Ensure the alarm does not trigger before the set time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock objects for hour, minute, and second to provide a specific future time, and mock datetime to return a current time that is earlier.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function.
  Assert: Confirm that the "Time to Wake up" message is not printed and no sound is played.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the alarm function does not trigger prematurely, which would be a failure of its core functionality.

Scenario 3: Verify Continuous Check Until Alarm Time
Details:
  TestName: test_continuous_check_until_alarm_time
  Description: Ensure the function continuously checks the time until the alarm is triggered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock datetime to provide sequential current times leading up to the alarm time.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function checks the time at regular intervals and triggers the alarm when appropriate.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's loop logic correctly performs repeated checks, vital for its continuous monitoring behavior.

Scenario 4: Validate Sound Playback on Alarm Trigger
Details:
  TestName: test_sound_playback_on_alarm_trigger
  Description: Ensure the correct sound is played when the alarm is triggered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock winsound.PlaySound to track if it is called and set the alarm time to match the current time.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function.
  Assert: Verify that winsound.PlaySound is called with the correct parameters.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to execute the correct action (playing sound) upon alarm trigger, which is central to user notification.
