Scenario 1: Verify Alarm Trigger at Set Time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_triggers_at_set_time
  Description: Ensure that the alarm triggers correctly when the current time matches the set alarm time.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Mock the hour, minute, and second to return a specific time, e.g., 07:30:00.
    - Use a mock or patch to simulate the current time as 07:30:00.
  Act: 
    - Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: 
    - Verify that the "Time to Wake up" message is printed.
    - Confirm that `winsound.PlaySound` is called with the correct parameters.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the alarm function's primary purpose—triggering an alert at a specified time—is fulfilled. It ensures that the function reacts appropriately when the current time equals the set alarm time.

Scenario 2: Verify Alarm Does Not Trigger Before Set Time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_does_not_trigger_before_time
  Description: Ensure that the alarm does not trigger before the current time matches the set alarm time.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Mock the hour, minute, and second to return a future time, e.g., 07:30:00.
    - Use a mock or patch to simulate the current time as 07:29:59.
  Act: 
    - Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: 
    - Verify that the "Time to Wake up" message is not printed.
    - Confirm that `winsound.PlaySound` is not called.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the alarm does not trigger prematurely, maintaining user expectations and preventing false alarms.

Scenario 3: Verify Alarm Does Not Trigger After Set Time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_does_not_trigger_after_time
  Description: Ensure that the alarm does not trigger if the current time has already passed the set alarm time.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Mock the hour, minute, and second to return a past time, e.g., 07:30:00.
    - Use a mock or patch to simulate the current time as 07:30:01.
  Act: 
    - Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: 
    - Verify that the "Time to Wake up" message is not printed.
    - Confirm that `winsound.PlaySound` is not called.
Validation:
  This test checks that the alarm does not sound if the set time has already passed, ensuring accurate and timely alerts.

Scenario 4: Verify Continuous Checking of Time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_continuous_checking
  Description: Ensure that the alarm function continuously checks the time, waiting for the correct moment to trigger the alarm.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Mock the hour, minute, and second to return a future time, e.g., 07:30:00.
    - Use a mock or patch to simulate a sequence of current times leading up to the alarm time.
  Act: 
    - Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: 
    - Verify that the function continues to loop and check the time until it matches the alarm time.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's logic to run in a loop, continuously checking the time, which is crucial for the function's reliability.

Scenario 5: Verify Handling of Invalid Time Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_handles_invalid_time_inputs
  Description: Ensure that the alarm function handles invalid time inputs gracefully, without crashing.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Mock the hour, minute, and second to return invalid values, e.g., 25:61:61.
  Act: 
    - Invoke the `alarm` function.
  Assert: 
    - Verify that the function does not crash or behave unexpectedly.
    - Confirm that no alarm is triggered.
Validation:
  This test ensures the robustness of the function by checking how it handles invalid input, preventing potential runtime errors.
