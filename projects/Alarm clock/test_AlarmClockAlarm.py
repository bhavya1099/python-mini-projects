### Alarm Function Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Alarm Triggered at Correct Time
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_alarm_triggered_at_set_time
  - Description: Verify that the alarm successfully triggers at a time that matches the set alarm time.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Mock the `datetime.datetime.now` to return a controlled current time and set the `hour`, `minute`, and `second` globals to match this time.
  - Act: Allow the alarm function to iterate until the current time matches the set alarm time.
  - Assert: Check that `winsound.PlaySound` is called with the correct parameters ("sound.wav" and `winsound.SND_ASYNC`) when the times match.

**Validation:**
  - This test checks the primary functionality of the alarm function, ensuring it triggers correctly at the defined time, which is a crucial requirement for any alarm software.

#### Scenario 2: Alarm Not Triggered Before Set Time
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_alarm_not_triggered_before_set_time
  - Description: Ensure that the alarm does not trigger before the time it is set for.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Mock `datetime.datetime.now` to return a time one second before the alarm time and set the `hour`, `minute`, and `second` to a specific target time.
  - Act: Run the alarm function and allow the one-second delay.
  - Assert: Confirm that `winsound.PlaySound` is not called prematurely.

**Validation:**
  - Checks the reliability of the alarm to avoid false positives, ensuring it only triggers at the precise scheduled time, which is essential for user trust and utility.

#### Scenario 3: Continuous Monitoring Over Multiple Checks
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_alarm_does_not_trigger_repeatedly_once_gone_off
  - Description: Confirm that once the alarm triggers, it does not keep triggering in subsequent checks if the set time and current time remain the same.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Mock `datetime.datetime.now` to continuously return the same time as the set alarm time for several iterations.
  - Act: Run the alarm function through multiple cycles.
  - Assert: Verify that `winsound.PlaySound` is called only once.

**Validation:**
  - Ensures that the alarm does not behave erratically by repeatedly triggering for the same instance thus avoiding repeated disturbances and ensuring proper behavior in "edge" conditions.

#### Scenario 4: Time Format Matching and Comparison
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_alarm_time_format_and_comparison
  - Description: Test if the alarm correctly compares times in appropriate formats, ensuring no discrepancies due to formatting.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Intentionally set `hour`, `minute`, and `second` with leading zeros or other common time variations.
  - Act: Allow the alarm function to process the fetch and comparison of current time to set time.
  - Assert: Ensure the comparison correctly identifies matches despite potentially different string formats.

**Validation:**
  - Validates the robustness of time comparison logic in the function, crucial for reliability in recognizing the correct time to trigger the alarm.

#### Scenario 5: Alarm Trigger Logic During Boundary Times (Midnight)
**Details:**
  - TestName: test_alarm_at_boundary_times
  - Description: Verify that the alarm function correctly triggers at boundary times such as exactly at midnight.

**Execution:**
  - Arrange: Set `hour`, `minute`, and `second` to 00:00:00 and mock `datetime.datetime.now` to return this time when checked.
  - Act: Allow the alarm loop to engage at the boundary time.
  - Assert: Check that `winsound.PlaySound` is triggered as expected at midnight.

**Validation:**
  - Important to ensure the alarmâ€™s accuracy and reliability across all times of the day, including transitional moments like midnight, which often have edge-case behaviors in time-based applications.
