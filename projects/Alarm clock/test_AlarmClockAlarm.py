ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=alarm_6edf31f1cc


Scenario 1: Verify Alarm Trigger at Set Time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_triggers_at_set_time
  Description: Ensure that the alarm triggers correctly when the current time matches the set alarm time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock objects for hour, minute, and second to provide a specific alarm time. Mock datetime to control the current time.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function in a controlled environment where the current time will match the set alarm time.
  Assert: Check if "Time to Wake up" is printed and winsound.PlaySound is called with "sound.wav".
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the alarm function performs its primary purpose of alerting at the correct time, ensuring reliability in time-sensitive scenarios.

Scenario 2: Validate Non-Trigger Before Set Time
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_does_not_trigger_before_set_time
  Description: Confirm that the alarm does not trigger when the current time is before the set alarm time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock objects for hour, minute, and second to provide a specific alarm time. Mock datetime to simulate a time before the set alarm time.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function and let it run for a short period before the alarm time.
  Assert: Ensure that "Time to Wake up" is not printed and winsound.PlaySound is not called.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the alarm function does not falsely trigger, maintaining user trust and preventing unnecessary disturbances.

Scenario 3: Validate Continuous Check After Trigger
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_continues_checking_after_trigger
  Description: Verify that the alarm function continues to check the time even after the alarm has triggered once.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock objects for hour, minute, and second for a specific alarm time. Mock datetime to simulate the current time hitting the alarm time and then moving past it.
  Act: Run the alarm function through the transition from before the alarm time, through the alarm time, and after it.
  Assert: Confirm that "Time to Wake up" is printed only once, and winsound.PlaySound is called once, ensuring continuous operation.
Validation:
  This test is essential to validate that the function can handle multiple invocations and continues to operate after an alarm trigger, which is critical for long-running applications.

Scenario 4: Handle Invalid Alarm Time Gracefully
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_handles_invalid_time_gracefully
  Description: Ensure that the function can gracefully handle invalid time inputs without crashing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up mock objects for hour, minute, and second to provide an invalid alarm time format.
  Act: Invoke the alarm function with this setup.
  Assert: Verify that the function does not crash and handles the situation without any exceptions. Check if the alarm does not trigger.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure robustness and fault tolerance, providing a seamless user experience even when invalid inputs are encountered.

Scenario 5: Verify Alarm Sound File Existence
Details:
  TestName: test_alarm_sound_file_exists
  Description: Confirm that the alarm function checks for the existence of the specified sound file and handles its absence.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock winsound.PlaySound to simulate the absence of "sound.wav".
  Act: Run the alarm function when the alarm time is reached.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate error message or handling mechanism is invoked if the sound file is not found.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring the user is informed of configuration issues, maintaining the reliability and effectiveness of the alarm functionality.
