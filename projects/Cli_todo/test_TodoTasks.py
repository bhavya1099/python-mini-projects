### Scenario 1: Tasks list is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_tasks_with_empty_task_list
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles an empty task list by displaying a message to add new tasks.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the `ctx` object with an empty 'TASKS' dictionary.
  Act: Call the `tasks` function with the prepared `ctx`.
  Assert: Check that the output is "No tasks yet! Use ADD to add one.\n".
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring that the function can handle the scenario where no tasks have been added yet, which is a common initial state.

### Scenario 2: Tasks list contains multiple tasks
Details:
  TestName: test_tasks_with_multiple_tasks
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly displays all tasks in the list, formatted as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the `ctx` object with a 'TASKS' dictionary containing multiple key-value pairs.
  Act: Call the `tasks` function with the prepared `ctx`.
  Assert: Check that the output includes each task formatted as "â€¢ [task description] (ID: [id])".
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming that the function can accurately display multiple tasks, which is essential for users to view their tasks.

### Scenario 3: Tasks list has a single task
Details:
  TestName: test_tasks_with_single_task
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles and displays a single task.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the `ctx` object with a 'TASKS' dictionary containing one key-value pair.
  Act: Call the `tasks` function with the prepared `ctx`.
  Assert: Verify that the output correctly shows the single task in the specified format.
Validation:
  Rationalize why this scenario is critical by verifying that the function handles the minimal non-empty case, which is a frequent real-world scenario.

### Scenario 4: Tasks list contains special characters in task descriptions
Details:
  TestName: test_tasks_with_special_characters
  Description: This test checks if the function can correctly handle and display tasks that include special characters in their descriptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the `ctx` object with a 'TASKS' dictionary where task descriptions contain special characters (e.g., newline, emoji).
  Act: Call the `tasks` function with the prepared `ctx`.
  Assert: Ensure that the output displays the tasks correctly with the special characters.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance by ensuring that the function can handle task descriptions with non-standard characters, catering to a diverse set of task entries.

### Scenario 5: Tasks list has very long task descriptions
Details:
  TestName: test_tasks_with_long_descriptions
  Description: This test verifies if the function can handle and correctly display tasks with very long descriptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the `ctx` object with a 'TASKS' dictionary containing tasks with unusually long descriptions.
  Act: Call the `tasks` function with the prepared `ctx`.
  Assert: Check that the output includes the full descriptions without truncation.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test by ensuring that the function can handle and display long descriptions, which might be used by users to provide detailed task information.
