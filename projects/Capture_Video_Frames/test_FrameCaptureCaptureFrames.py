### Scenario 1: Video file has multiple frames
Details:
  TestName: test_capture_multiple_frames
  Description: Verify that the method captures and saves each frame from a video file with multiple frames.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `cv2.VideoCapture` and its `read` method to simulate reading multiple frames from a video file.
  Act: Call the `capture_frames` method.
  Assert: Check that multiple files are created in the directory, each corresponding to a frame in the video.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function captures every frame from a video with multiple frames, as intended by the business logic to process and store each frame separately. This is crucial for applications requiring frame-by-frame analysis or manipulation.

### Scenario 2: Video file is empty (no frames)
Details:
  TestName: test_capture_no_frames
  Description: Ensure that the method handles the case where the video file contains no frames.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `cv2.VideoCapture` to return no frames (i.e., `read` returns `False, None`).
  Act: Call the `capture_frames` method.
  Assert: Verify that no files are created in the directory.
Validation:
  Validates the function's robustness in handling edge cases where the video file might be empty, ensuring that the system gracefully handles such scenarios without creating unnecessary output or errors.

### Scenario 3: Video file path is invalid
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_file_path
  Description: Check the method's behavior when provided with an invalid video file path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an invalid file path to the class constructor.
  Act: Call the `capture_frames` method.
  Assert: Expect an error to be raised or handled gracefully.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the method can handle errors related to file access appropriately, which is critical for robustness in a production environment where file paths might be dynamically specified.

### Scenario 4: Ensure frame saving integrity
Details:
  TestName: test_frame_saving_integrity
  Description: Confirm that each frame saved is the exact frame read from the video.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `cv2.VideoCapture` and its method `read` to return controlled, known frames.
  Act: Call the `capture_frames` method.
  Assert: Verify that the images saved in the directory match the mocked frames in content.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the integrity of the data handling within the method, ensuring that frames are not only captured but also saved without corruption or alteration, which is crucial for applications where data fidelity is paramount.

### Scenario 5: Concurrency in frame capturing
Details:
  TestName: test_concurrency_in_frame_capturing
  Description: Assess the function's behavior under concurrent execution to simulate real-world usage where multiple instances might be running.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple instances of the class and invoke `capture_frames` concurrently.
  Act: Execute `capture_frames` method across different threads or processes.
  Assert: Validate that each instance writes to its respective directory without data corruption or overlap.
Validation:
  This test is essential for applications that might require simultaneous video processing, ensuring that the system can handle such load without interference between instances.
